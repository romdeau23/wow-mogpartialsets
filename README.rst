MogPartialSets (WoW addon)
##########################

Tired of having to search for set items one-by-one just because you are missing an unimportant piece?
This small addon will let you see incomplete sets in the transmogrification dialog and more!

Features
********

This addon adds a new "Filter" button to the top-right of the transmogrification window (when on the "Sets" tab).

The following options are available:

- **show extra sets** - show additional sets that are normally hidden (lookalike sets for other classes etc.)
- **only favorite sets** - show only sets that you have favorited
- **only favorite variants** - also show variants of favorite sets (if **only favorite sets** is on)
- **use hidden item if missing** - when applying a set, use a hidden item for all missing slots
- **max missing pieces** - maximum number of missing pieces for a set to show up in the list
- **equipment slots** - set options for specific slots

  - **ignored** - if enabled, the slot will not count towards **max missing pieces**
  - **hidden** - if enabled, the slot will always be set to a hidden item
    (and also not count towards **max missing pieces**)
